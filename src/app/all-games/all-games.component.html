    Welcome to Treachery! A fun game to play with your friends. You need at
    least 4 people to play this game. You can either create a game or join one
    from the list below. When you create a game, you act as the forensic
    scientist, and your 3 friends can join the game as investigators. When you
    start the game, a player from the investigators will be randomly chosen to
    be the murderer, and your objective as a forensic scientist is to provide
    clues to the players as to who the murderer is. As an investigator, each one
    of you gets one guess to figure out who the murderer is. If you're chosen as
    the murderer, you get to choose a means and a clue card. Use the chat to
    discuss amongst yourselves, and find the murderer! Or deceive investigators
    if you are the murderer.
